# Multithreaded Programming

> A thread has its own **Thread Control Block (TCB)**, **thread ID**, **program counter**, **register set**, and **stack** (not shared among threads).

---

## Benefits of Multithreading
1. **Responsiveness** – improve interactive performance.  
2. **Resource sharing** – threads share the same memory space.  
3. **Utilization of Multiprocessor Architecture** – true **parallelism**.  
4. **Economy** – lighter than processes, better resource utilization.  

---

## Multithreaded Programming Categories
- **Shared-memory model** (multithreading)  
- **Message-passing model**

---

## Challenges
1. **Dividing tasks** – split program into concurrent tasks.  
2. **Data splitting** – partition data to be accessed/manipulated by tasks.  
3. **Data dependency** – synchronize data access to avoid race conditions.  
4. **Balance** – evenly distribute tasks to cores.  
5. **Testing and debugging** – harder than sequential programs.

## User Threads vs. Kernel Threads

- **User Threads**  
  - Managed in **user space** by a threads library.  
  - Examples: POSIX Pthreads, Win32 threads, Java threads.  

- **Kernel Threads**  
  - Directly supported and managed by the **OS kernel**.

## Multithreading Models

### 1. Many-to-One
- Many user threads map to **one kernel thread**.  
- Limitation: if one thread makes a blocking call, the entire process blocks.  
- Only one thread can access the kernel at a time → **no parallelism** on multiprocessors.

### 2. One-to-One
- Each user thread maps to a **kernel thread**.  
- Provides concurrency and parallelism.  
- Limitation: number of kernel threads is restricted.

### 3. Many-to-Many
- Many user threads map to a smaller or equal number of kernel threads.  
- Allows creation of as many user threads as needed.  
- Provides flexibility and better resource usage.

# Threading Issues

## Semantics of `fork()` and `exec()`
- `fork()` could be:
  1. Copy the whole process
  2. Copy the thread only
- `execlp()` replaces the entire process

---

## Thread Cancellation
1. **Asynchronous cancellation**  
   Cancel the thread immediately when the main thread decides.
2. **Deferred cancellation**  
   Cancel the thread only when it reaches a checkpoint.

---

## Signal Handling
Signals notify a process that an event has occurred.

1. Generated by a particular event
2. Delivered to a process
3. Signal is handled

**Signal can be delivered to:**
1. The thread to which the signal applies  
2. Every thread of the process  
3. A certain thread of the process  
4. The specific thread (e.g., main thread) designated to handle signals for the process

## Thread Pools
> Create threads in a pool staying await to work

* Faster to handle request
* Control the number of threads application allowed to be used
