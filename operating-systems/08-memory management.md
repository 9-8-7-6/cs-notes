# Memory Management
## Background
- Main memory and registers are the only storage CPU can access directly
- Multiple programs are brought into memory to improve performance and utilization
- A process may be moved between disk and memory(Virtual memory)

## Multistep Processing of a User Program

### Compile Time: compile or assemble
 
### Link Time: Link different library, include static linking

### Load Time: load into memory, include static loading

### Execution Time(run time): include dynamically loaded and linking

## Address Binding
### Address binding - Compile Time
- Very fast
- ES-DOS .COM format binary
- Hard to move program, need to recompile and re-execute

### Address binding - Load Time
- Compiler translate symbolic code into relocatable code(use base register)
- Still need to reload the code if need to move memory or swap in

### Address Binding - Execution Time

- Compiler translate symbolic code into logical-address(i.e. virtual-address) code
- MMU(hardware) is needed for this scheme
    - ![MMU](https://er.yuvayana.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/05/Memory-Management-F10.png)
- Logical address(generated by *CPU*)
- Physical address(seen by memory module)
- Execution-time => logical address != physical address
