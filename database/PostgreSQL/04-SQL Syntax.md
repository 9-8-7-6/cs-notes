# SQL Syntax

## Lexical Structure
- A command is terminated by a semicolon (;)
- A dollar sign ($) followed by digits is used to:
    - Represent a positional parameter in function definitions or prepared statements.
    - In other contexts, $ can be part of:
        - An identifier
        - A dollar-quoted string constant
- Parentheses (())
    - Used to group expressions and enforce precedence.
    - Sometimes required as part of the fixed syntax of certain SQL commands.
- Brackets ([])
    - Used to select elements from an array.
- Commas (,)
    - Used to separate elements in a list within various SQL constructs.
- Semicolon (;)
    - Used to terminate an SQL command
    - Cannot appear inside a command, except in:
        - A string constant
        - A quoted identifier
- Colon (:)
    - Used to select slices from arrays (see Section 8.15).
    - In some SQL dialects (e.g., Embedded SQL), used to prefix variable names.
- Asterisk (*)
    - Represents all fields of a table row or composite value.
    - In aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT(*)), it denotes the aggregate has no explicit parameter.
- Period (.)

        - Numeric constants
        - Separating schema, table, and column names
