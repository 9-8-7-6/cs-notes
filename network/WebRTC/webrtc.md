# WebRTC(Web Real Time Communication)

## Overview
* P2P with **standardize API** exchange media(vedio and audio) in efficient and low latency way

### Connection Process
1. **Discovery**  
   - A finds out all possible ways the public can connect to it.  
   - B does the same.  

2. **Signaling**  
   - A and B exchange connection/session information via an external signaling channel (not defined by WebRTC).  
   - Examples: WhatsApp, QR code, Tweet, WebSockets, HTTP fetch, etc.

3. **Establishing Connection**  
   - A connects to B via the **most optimal path** (using ICE to select the best candidate: direct, STUN, or TURN).  

4. **Capability Exchange**  
   - Both peers exchange supported **media formats** and **security parameters** to ensure compatibility and end-to-end encryption.  

## Concept
* Network Address Translation(NAT)
   * If target is not under same subnet, can't connect directly
   * Gateway create a **NAT table** ![](https://d2cest1yk6hx2d.cloudfront.net/uninets-001/store/3057/article%20images/network-address-translation-table.jpg)
   * NAT Translations Method
      * One to One NAT(Static NAT)
         * Port on the router always maps to internal IP(fixed mapping)
      * Address restricted NAT
         * Allowed to receive only if the internal host has sent first(matching IP only)
      * Port restricted NAT
         * Allowed to receive only if the internal host has sent first (matching IP + Port)
      * Symmetric NAT
         * Allowed to receive only if the full 4-tuple (Internal IP, Internal Port â†’ Target IP, Target Port) matches
         * Mapping is unique per destination, cannot be reused for different targets
* STUN & TURN
* ICE
* SDP
* Signaling the SDP

## Summary
- WebRTC focuses on **real-time, secure, peer-to-peer communication**.
- The signaling mechanism is **application-defined**, not part of WebRTC itself.
- Once established, the connection is **direct and encrypted**, **minimizing latency**.
- Supports not only **audio/video streaming** but also **arbitrary data transfer** through DataChannels.
