# Algorithm
> Function to generate the **correct** and **effiency Output** for **Input**

## Efficiency

The time to solve problem might difference depend on machine resource

- Don't measure wall-clock time because different machines or environments can affect result
- Count operations instead
- Expect performance to depend on the size of our input (n)


### Asymptotic Notation
  - O(f(n)) upper bound(worst-case)
  - Ω(f(n)) lower bound(best-case)
  -  Θ(f(n)) both
